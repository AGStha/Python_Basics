    "Python has been an object-oriented language since the time it existed. Due to this, creating and using classes and objects are downright easy. This chapter helps you become an expert in using Python's object-oriented programming support.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not have any previous experience with object-oriented (OO) programming, you may want to consult an introductory course on it or at least a tutorial of some sort so that you have a grasp of the basic concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, here is a small introduction of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to help you −\n",
    "Overview of OOP Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "    Class − A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Class variable − A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods. Class variables are not used as frequently as instance variables are.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Data member − A class variable or instance variable that holds data associated with a class and its objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Function overloading − The assignment of more than one behavior to a particular function. The operation performed varies by the types of objects or arguments involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Instance variable − A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Inheritance − The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Instance − An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Instantiation − The creation of an instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Method − A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Object − A unique instance of a data structure that is defined by its class. An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Operator overloading − The assignment of more than one function to a particular operator.\n"
