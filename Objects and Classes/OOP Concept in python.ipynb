There are three important characteristics by which it is identified, they are:\n",

The reason behind doing this is to create several levels of accessing an object's data and prevent it from accidental modification. Also, hiding, or setting up privacy levels, can be done for functions as well.\n",

Since the beginning we have been talking about objects, its data, functions, privacy etc., now it's time to know how is all this kept bounded. The answer is encapsulation.
